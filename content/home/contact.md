### About 1 World Connected

1 World Connected is a research project of the [Center for Technology, Innovation and Competition](https://www.law.upenn.edu/institutes/ctic/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). The project is led by Professor [Christopher Yoo](https://www.law.upenn.edu/cf/faculty/csyoo/),  John H. Chestnut Professor of Law, Information and Computer Science. [Sharada Srinivasan](https://www.law.upenn.edu/cf/faculty/sharadas/) and [Müge Haseki](https://www.law.upenn.edu/cf/faculty/mhaseki/) are full-time Research Fellows that work on the project.

### How We Work

We compile [case studies](#projects) after conducting hour long, in-depth, semi-structured interviews with project organizations. This information is supplemented by secondary desk research.

### Who We Hope to Impact

A systematic compilation of all initiatives to connect the unconnected has the capability to be useful to governments and other organizations who are interested in implementing or funding such initiatives. Spotlighting efforts made by various stakeholders, and providing an empirical basis for the success or failure of initiatives funnels investment in the right directions.

### Use of Data

We use case studies to share experiences about different initiatives’ approaches to improving Internet adoption. We [disseminate this information widely](#publications) through various channels, including brochures, opinion articles, news interviews, radio and television outlets, blog posts as well as reports and academic publications. We do not make money from the publication of this information.

We publish not only case studies that show success, but also highlight the lessons learned from failures where possible. Our commitment to academic integrity ensures that we will make all information that we can potentially make available accessible on our website to everyone. We seek informed consent from our participants before publicly releasing information on their projects.

### Supporters and Partners

The three-year project is presently supported by American Tower, AT&T, Cellular Operators Association of India, Comcast, Disney, Facebook, Intel, ICANN, Internet Society, ITI, Microsoft, and Verizon. We coordinate the [Dynamic Coalition on Innovative Approaches to Connecting the Unconnected](https://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/content/dynamic-coalition-on-innovative-approaches-to-connecting-the-unconnected-0) under the aegis of United Nations Internet Governance Forum with Helani Galpaya (LIRNEasia), Michael Kende (Internet Society), and Rajan Mathews (Cellular Operators Association of India). In 2017, we co-convened [Connecting and Enabling the Next Billions - Phase III](https://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/content/policy-options-for-connecting-and-enabling-the-next-billions-%E2%80%93-phase-iii-0) with the Internet Society. We partner with IEEE’s [Internet Inclusion Initiative](https://internetinitiative.ieee.org/), USAID's [Digital Inclusion](http://www.digitaldevelopment.org/) team, and the World Economic Forum’s [Internet for All](https://www.weforum.org/projects/internet-for-all) to advance common aims.
