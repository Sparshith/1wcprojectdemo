### Who We are

1 World Connected is a research project of the Center for Technology, Innovation and Competition at the University of Pennsylvania. The project is led by Professor Christopher Yoo, the center’s founding director and John H. Chestnut Professor of Law, Information and Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania’s Law School. Sharada Srinivasan and Dr. Muge Haseki are full-time Research Fellows that work on the project. <!--more-->

### How We Work

We compile case studies after conducting hour long, in-depth, semi-structured interviews with project organizations. This information is supplemented by secondary desk research. We endeavour to update our information so long as the project is live.

### Who We Hope to Impact

A systematic compilation of all initiatives to connect the unconnected has the capability to be useful to governments and other organizations who are interested in implementing or funding such initiatives. Spotlighting efforts made by various stakeholders, and providing an empirical basis for the success or failure of initiatives funnels investment in the right directions, leading to enhanced outcomes for the investment that is being made across the world in Internet deployment.

### Policy on Use of Data

We use case studies to share experiences about different initiatives’ approaches to improving Internet adoption. We disseminate this information widely through various channels, including brochures, opinion articles, news interviews, radio and television outlets, blog posts as well as reports and academic publications. We do not make money from the publication of this information.

We will publish not only case studies that show success, but also highlight the lessons learned from failures where possible. Our commitment to academic integrity ensures that we will make all information that we can potentially make available accessible on our website to everyone. In unique circumstances where case study candidates do not wish to divulge some information for reasons of security or threat to their person, we will respect that.

### Relationship with the Dynamic Coalition on Innovative Approaches to Connecting the Unconnected

1 World Connected is working in conjunction with the dynamic coalition under the aegis of United Nations Internet Governance Forum. Professor Christopher Yoo of 1 World Connected is one of the conveners of the dynamic coalition. The other conveners of the dynamic coalition are Helani Galpaya (LIRNEasia), Michael Kende (Internet Society), and Rajan Mathews (Cellular Operators Association of India).

### Supporters

We accept financial contributions from all interested parties to this endeavor, including individual donations, corporate sponsorship and grants. The three-year project is presently supported by American Tower, AT&T, Cellular Operators Association of India, Comcast, Disney, Facebook, Intel, ICANN, Internet Society, ITI, Microsoft, and Verizon. We partner with IEEE’s Internet Inclusion Initiative, World Economic Forum’s Internet for All, USAID, and other such organizations, to advance common aims. <!--more-->
