Executive Summary
==================

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) launched the
Adaptive Technology Center for the Blind (ATCB) in 2003 in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia to provide access to information and communication technologies
for the blind and visually impaired people. The ITU and ATCB provided
the training equipment and software that produces Braille by
computerized embossers to its users for the first two years. The center
is now a non-profit resource and information technology center open to
all visually impaired Ethiopians.

Context
=======

Ethiopia is one of the world's untouched telecom markets, with complete
state control over Internet access. Ethio Telecom is the sole provider
of Internet access in the country. Mobile phone penetration is close to
40 percent, well below the continent-wide average of 75 percent. Less
than 2 percent of the Ethiopians have access to fixed line internet
connections.

According to the United States-based International Eye Foundation (IEF),
there are about 45 million blind people in the world, the vast majority
of them living in Africa. In Ethiopia, the latest census indicates that
there are well over 500,000 blind people in the country. In June 2000,
ATCB was established to bring information accessibility to the blind and
visually impaired people in Ethiopia.

Project Description
===================

In 2003, UNESCO built partnership with ATCB to support their efforts
with the blind and visually impaired in Ethiopia, and to draw attention
to the blind-focused initiatives in Africa. The Adaptive Technology
Center for the Blind set up the Pioneers Collegiate for the Blind, which
trains blind and visually challenged users through vocational training
in basic computer skills. In 2008, the Center received a license to
operate as a Technical Vocational and Education Training (TVET)
institute. Each year, a cohort of 20-30 students graduates from this
institute.

The Center also has a Braille Transcription Center that has converted
over 2000 text books and other literature into both English and Amharic
text. It is collaborating with the Global Digital Resource Libraries to
make online information accessible to visually challenged individuals.

Additionally, the Adaptive Technology Center for the Blind also
organizes workshops in collaboration with the International
Telecommunications Union, UNESCO, and Internet Society to spread
awareness and engage in local capacity building in assistive
technologies.

The Adaptive Technology Center for the Blind has also set up an Internet
café at a central location in Addis Ababa, which has over 10 computers
that are equipped with adaptive technologies and text-to-speech
translation software that enables visually challenged users to utilize
the Internet at their ease.

Progress and results
====================

The Adaptive Technology Center for the Blind has trained more than 200
visually challenged people in basic computer skills. Since 2008, a
cohort with an average of about 25 students has graduated from the
Pioneer Collegiate.

Challenges
==========

**Legal regime --** The Ethiopian government requires all internet
access centers to be licensed under the law. Bureaucratic hurdles
involved in petitioning the appropriate agency for the grant of such
license exist, which consumes time and delays the deployment of cyber
cafés. Further, there is no clear policy on both the Federal and
Regional levels that addresses the rights of the blind and visually
impaired to information accessibility and other opportunities

**Lack of skilled manpower --** IT administrators and technicians
trained in adaptive technologies to aid users are in short supply, which
delays staffing for the maintenance of initiatives for the integrated
internet access center.

ATCB's Suggestions for Future Projects
======================================

**Capacity building is key** -- ATCB conducts a course for trainers and
students at five technical schools across Ethiopia. Proceeds from the
sale of Braille publications such as training manuals, newspapers and
other materials, as well as fees and charges from individuals and
organizations contribute to sustaining the initiative In order to expand
the existing ICT services for beneficiaries, and to make sure that the
vision and mission of ATCB are glued, ATCB engages in consultations with
policy makers, project-partners and curriculum designers through regular
workshops and individual mentoring.
